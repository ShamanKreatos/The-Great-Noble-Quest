# The-Great-Noble-Quest

We are putting forward an inspired vision - a bold plan - a call for noble people far and wide to join together to lay the foundations for a Universally Comprehensive Network of Cocreative Intelligence - to embark on the Great Noble Quest to usher in the peaceful thriving society of the future!

This Project is an initiative of the 501c3 non-profit organization The Infinite Program - devoted to tackling the Healing needs of our world as the only path that will allow humanity to progress to a more evolved and thriving society. Optimum Mental/Spiritual Health is the bedrock of a thriving, free and peaceful society. Without it we have the chaos that is self-evident in our world today. Our only path forward, the noble path, is to build a beautiful world from the inside out. 

The vision of the Digital Front of this initiative is to build an online platform that will serve as a 'Project for Humanity'. A portal dedicated to streamlining open cooperation on the task of establishing and maintaining nature-based Community Healing Sanctuaries in/near every major population center of the world. Dogma-free, division-free, profit-free, neutral space where people can gather together to find ones own inner healing while strengthening our community bond. Space to facilitate community to gather in peace and respect to explore, discuss and debate new uniting healing ways to build new alternatives to our decaying and chaotic current systems.

A more evolved society will not emerge from within our current chaotic system. It will only arise from the convergence of awakening consciousness. It is imperative that we create space for this convergence. It is vital that we create neutral space where humanity can come together as community, as family, as tribe - United through respect of our common humanity and the value of healing our shared mental/spiritual struggle that is central to the Human Experience. It is from this space that we will be able to begin building a Universally Comprehensive Network of Cocreative Intelligence. We envision this digital platform to be the space from which we begin the pre-formation of this great network by rallying our collective efforts to build a global web of Community Healing Sanctuaries. We envision that through this process, with the aid of a dedicated digital platform, a Cocreative Intelligence will begin to organically emerge.   

We envision that this great network of Cocreative Intelligence will be the source of knowledge, wisdom and resource necessary to usher in a thriving new era for humanity!
